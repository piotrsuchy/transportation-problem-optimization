## REQUIREMENTS:

To use this application it is necessary to have Python 3 and modules specified in the file 'requirements.txt' installed.
Temporarily, to run the program enter this command in the terminal in the folder to which the repo is cloned:

```zsh
$ python gui.py
```

## DOCUMENTATION:

29 pages of documentation for the initial stage of the project, together with certain performance tests were composed. 

This project was created by a group of 3 people for a course in Operational Research. At the time of the initial commit for this repository (March) the contributions for the code were as follows: Paweł Szwarnowski 781/1420, Piotr Suchy 568/1420, Mateusz Sztefko 71/1420. After finishing the project, I (Piotr Suchy) have decided to expand on it and add certain features solo. WIP
